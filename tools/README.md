# Tools configuratoin

You define the tools configurations here with a file named `tools.json` like what `tools.json.sample` like.


Each item within `tools.json` will be constructed into a `ToolConfig` object and be registered for later use.

Each `Tool` has a global unique name so that it can be refered in the `ModelConfig`.
